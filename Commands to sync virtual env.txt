Make sure to do pip freeze before pushing to github, then copy that output into requirements.txt
- only needed if something new was installed on virtual server, or updated
Also MAKE SURE to create a mysql dump file to be able to transfer database contents between computers.

virtualenv testEnv
testEnv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

In general before running app:
$env:FLASK_APP="hello.py"
$env:FLASK_DEBUG=1
