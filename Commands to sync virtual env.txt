Make sure to do pip freeze before pushing to github, then copy that output into requirements.txt
- only needed if something new was installed on virtual server, or updated
Also MAKE SURE to create a mysql dump file to be able to transfer database between computers.

virtualenv testEnv
testEnv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
$env:FLASK_APP="hello.py";
